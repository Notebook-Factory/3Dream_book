*** 
An interactive Jupyter Book for the highlighted paper by first author **Philipp Ehses** and last author **Tony Stöcker**, 
from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn, Germany. The paper is 
entitled *“Whole-brain B1-mapping using three-dimensional DREAM” (DREAM: Dual Refocusing Echo Acquisition Mode)*.


The Jupyter Book allows the demo script to be interactive inline (can change and run the code on the website) 
or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in your browser, both options requiring no installation. 
They last section is for some of the figures and data from the paper, made interactive using <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.
