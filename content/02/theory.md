***
After STE peparation with flip angle $\alpha$ and following the first imaging flip angle $\beta$, the FID and 
STE signal intesities  are given by 

$$
  S_{0}^{STE} =\frac{1}{2}sin\beta sin^{2}\alpha \cdot M_{0}
  \tag{1}
$$
and 

$$
  S_{0}^{FID} = sin\beta sin^{2}\alpha \cdot M_{0}
  \tag{2}
$$
From these intensities, the peparation flip angle can be obtained acording to (16): 

$$
  B_{1}^{+} = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma \tau}
  \tag{3}
$$

In case of an on-resonant STE preparation with block RF pulses, the magnitude of the driving B<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>
field can then be obtained from the following identity: 

$$
  \alpha = arctan \sqrt{\frac{2S_{0}^{STE}}{S_{0}^{FID}}}
  \tag{4}
$$

where $\gamma$ and $\tau$ denote the gyromagnetic ratio and the duration of the STE preparation pulse, respectively.
