<p>The inhomogeneity of the radiofrequency field is a common problem in MRI, especially at high and ultra-high 
magnetic field. For instance, the magnitude of the B1 field over the human brain can vary by up to 50% and 
more at 7T. This leads to an uneven signal level and contrast in the FOV and is especially problematic for
quantitative MRI. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of the B1 field is a prerequisite to counteract 
these effects—either by direct tailoring of the excitation, e.g. static1 or dynamic2 B1 shimming, or by
techniques that rely on simultaneous variation of B1 and gradient fields. Sometimes, it is also possible to apply the
correction in post-processing, as for example, in quantitative imaging. Due to these requirements, many different 
B1 mapping methods have been developed.In 2012, Nehrke and Börnert introduced the “dual refocusing echo acquisition 
mode" (DREAM) sequence which relies on a stimulated echo preparation followed by the joint acquisition of a stimulated
echo (STE), and free induction decay (FID) image with a single-shot low-angle gradient-echo readout.</p>
